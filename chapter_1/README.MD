# 1.1 Getting Started
The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first
program to write is the same for all languages:
Print the words

## Hello world
(`hello, world`)[hello_world/main.c]

## Fahrenheit to Celsius
The next program uses the formula C=(5/9)(F-32) to print the table of Fahrenheit
temperatures and their centigrade or Celsius equivalents.

#### Data types
- char     character - a single byte
- short    short integer
- long     long integer
- double   double-precision floating point

#### while loop
The while loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true (fahr
is less than or equal to upper), the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces)
is executed. Then the condition is re-tested, and if true, the body is executed again. When the
test becomes false (fahr exceeds upper) the loop ends, and execution continues at the
statement that follows the loop. There are no further statements in this program, so it
terminates.
